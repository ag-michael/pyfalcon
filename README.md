# pyfalcon
Crowdstrike Falcon streaming api client in python. 

## Usage:

You can run the stand-alone `pyfalcon.py` script which will use the `config.json` json configuration file to connect to the crowdstrike falcon streaming api. If you choose this method, you'll need to edit the script and modify the processor() function to process the returned data further. 

Alternatively you can import it as a module as part of your own separate project.
